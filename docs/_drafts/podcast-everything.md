title: "Podcast everything: how to turn any content to podcast feed"

I've been listening to podcasts for more than a decade.
The podcast app (Overcast FM in my case) is basically my most commonly used software.
But the moment you realize podcast is just an RSS feed with MP3 links (and no, YouTube channel is *not* a podcast), you can push much more content into your streaming app.

# Turn any YouTube channel into podcast

Let me reiterate my pet peeve: you don't have a _podcast_ if

1. you only publish videos on YouTube without audio files under RSS feed, or
2. you publish audio-only content, but only to YouTube
3. you publish both as a podcast and as a video channel, but your content without video (audio only) is meaningless, or

Now, there's nothing wrong with having a YouTube channel.
I subscribe to plenty of great channels, such as... TODO
However, 

# Recording online radios using `ffmpeg`

# Automatically adding timestamps from show description

# Turn text articles to audio podcast feed

# TODO

* podsync
* `ffmpeg` + CRON
* adding chapters


# Podcast listening like a pro

* Auto-skip intro and outro music, introduction, engagement incentives, ads. Define in/out length for each podcast. For some shows I skip the first 8 minutes (!) In that time you can listen to two full episodes of my podcast ;-) 

* Speed up! Some podcasts are hard, then I listen at 1.6x. For some I reach 2.5x. Speed up gradually to train your 🧠

* Some apps have smart speed feature that slows down or speeds up adaptively and cuts silence

* Use headphones with forward button. Skip unwanted in-episode ads and interruptions quickly

* Setup forward button to exactly 30s. Often ad slots are half a minute long

* Organize podcasts into playlists. With limited time you can listen to the interesting ones first

* Some people also organize playlists by “difficulty”, e.g. how much they have to focus

* Use push notifications when the most enjoyale podcasts arrive

* Forget about built-in iPhone player. I use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) and it has a ton of great features
