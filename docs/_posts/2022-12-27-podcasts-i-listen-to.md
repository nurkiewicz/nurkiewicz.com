### [Around IT in 256 seconds](https://nurkiewicz.com/)

Podcast for developers, testers, SREs... and their managers. I explain complex and convoluted technologies in a clear way, avoiding buzzwords and hype. Never longer than 4 minutes and 16 seconds. Because software development does not require hours of lectures, dev advocates' slide decks and hand waving. For those of you, who want to combat FOMO, while brushing your teeth. 256 seconds is plenty of time. If I can't explain something within this time frame, it's either too complex, or I don't understand it myself.

### [Nauka To Lubię](https://staging.naukatolubie.pl/)

Spora część mojego życia to tzw. seria fortunnych zdarzeń. Chciałem zostać lekarzem, a zostałem fizykiem. Pojechałem zwiedzać Wiedeń, a poznałem żonę. Chciałem robić doktorat i wyjechałem na prawie 4 lata do największego centrum naukowego w Europie. Chcieliśmy powiększyć rodzinę i urodziły się bliźniaki. W końcu wróciliśmy z emigracji, żebym mógł zostać naukowcem, a zostałem dziennikarzem.

Nazywam się Tomasz Rożek. Z wykształcenia jestem fizykiem a z zawodu dziennikarzem naukowym. Kieruję działem naukowym w tygodniku Gość Niedzielny.  Współpracuję lub współpracowałem z wieloma mediami m.in.: z  redakcjami: Pytanie na Śniadanie, Teleexpress, Dzień Dobry TVN; Wiedzą i Życiem, magazynem National Geographic, Gazetą Wyborczą, Rzeczpospolitą, magazynem Focus. Byłem autorem oraz prowadzącym program Sonda2 w TVP2. Wspóltworzyłem programy radiowe: „Pytania z kosmosu” oraz Klub Trójki.

Piszę nie tylko dla periodyków. Moja pierwsza książka „Nauka – po prostu. Wywiady z wybitnymi” (2011, Demart) została uznana za najlepszą książkę popularno-naukową sezonu 2010-2011. W 2012 roku napisałem „Nauka – to lubię. Od ziarnka piasku do gwiazd” (WAB). W 2014 roku ukazała się moja książka „Kosmos” (WAB). W 2015 roku ukazał się „Człowiek” (WAB). To dwie części pop-naukowej trylogii. W trzeciej części opiszę mikrokosmos.

Prowadzę pop-naukowego vbloga Nauka. To lubię i facebookowy fanpage Nauka.To lubię. A od teraz także podcast.

Jestem obecny w dyskusjach na Twiterze oraz Instagramie.

Jestem szczęśliwym tatą bliźniaków Zuzi i Janka, oraz mężem Ani. Mieszkamy na Śląsku.
