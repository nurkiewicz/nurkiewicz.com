In one of my previous <a href="http://nurkiewicz.com/2009/08/spring-aop-riddle.html">posts</a> I gave you an example of some unexpected behavior when using Spring AOP proxies. Few days later I began to read "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Spring-2-5-PRO-SPRING/dp/B001TKL4SC">Pro Spring 2.5</a>" by Jan Machacek, Jessica Ditt, Aleksa Vukotic and Anirvan Chakraborty. It turned out that my riddle is actually a well known problem which has more than one solution. Also one of my Readers suggested some different approach.<br /><br />This almost <span style="font-style: italic;">nine-hundred-pages</span> book has a whole section in Chapter 6: <span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced AOP </span>introducing the problem which I believed I have discovered. There is even a programmatic solution, similar to EJBâ€™s <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/ejb/SessionContext.html#getBusinessObject%28java.lang.Class%29">SessionContext.getBusinessObject()</a>. But if the EJB method may be treated as somewhat standardized, using <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/aop/framework/AopContext.html#currentProxy%28%29">AopContext.currentProxy()</a> looks awkward and unnecessarily couples you to the Spring framework. I almost feel guilty for telling you about this method and you should feel the same if you thought about using it. Luckily, authors of "<span style="font-style: italic;">Pro Spring 2.5</span>" also discourage its use.<br /><br />So if you want to have in-depth understanding of Spring AOP, I suggests you to take I look at this book. Or at least follow my blog, as I will surely present a few more concepts considering Spring AOP and AspectJ in the future. Stay tuned!
