Every time you are making a logging statement, you think hard which logging level is appropriate for this type of event, do you? Somehow 90% of programmers never pay attention to logging levels, simply logging <span style="font-weight: bold;">everything</span> on the same level, typically <span style="font-family: courier new;">INFO</span> or DEBUG. Why? Logging frameworks have two major benefits over <span style="font-family: courier new;">System.out</span>: categories and levels. Both allow you to selectively filter logging statements permanently or only for diagnostics time. If you really can’t see the difference, print this table and look at it every time you start typing "<span style="font-family: courier new;">log.</span>" in your IDE:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;">ERROR </span>– something terribly wrong had happened, that must be investigated immediately. No system can tolerate items logged on this level. Example: NPE, database unavailable, mission critical use case cannot be continued.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;">WARN </span>– the process might be continued, but take extra caution. Actually I always wanted to have two levels here: one for obvious problems where work-around exists (for example: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Current data unavailable, using cached values</span>") and second (name it: <span style="font-family: courier new;">ATTENTION</span>) for potential problems and suggestions. Example: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Application running in development mode</span>" or "<span style="font-style: italic;">Administration console is not secured with a password</span>". The application can tolerate warning messages, but they should always be justified and examined.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;">INFO</span> – Important business process has finished. In ideal world, administrator or advanced user should be able to understand INFO messages and quickly find out what the application is doing. For example if an application is all about booking airplane tickets, there should be only one INFO statement per each ticket saying "<span style="font-style: italic;">[Who] booked ticket from [Where] to [Where]</span>". Other definition of INFO message: each action that changes the state of the application significantly (database update, external system request).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;">DEBUG</span> – Developers stuff. I will discuss later what sort of information deserves to be logged.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new;">TRACE</span> – Very detailed information, intended only for development. You might keep trace messages for a short period of time after deployment on production environment, but treat these log statements as temporary, that should or might be turned-off eventually. The distinction between <span style="font-family: courier new;">DEBUG</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new;">TRACE </span>is the most difficult, but if you put logging statement and remove it after the feature has been developed and tested, it should probably be on <span style="font-family: courier new;">TRACE</span> level.<br /><br />The list above is just a suggestion, you can create your own set of instructions to follow, but it is important to have any. Although my experience is that always, everything is logged without filtering (at least from the application code), having the ability to quickly filter logs and extract the information with proper detail level might be a life-saver.<br /><br />The last thing worth mentioning is infamous <span style="font-family: courier new;">is*Enabled()</span> condition. Some put it before every logging statement:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: java">if(log.isDebugEnabled())<br />    log.debug("Place for your commercial");</pre><br /><br />Personally, I find this idiom being just a clutter that should be avoided. The performance improvement (especially when using <a href="http://www.slf4j.org">SLF4J</a> pattern substitution discussed <a href="http://nurkiewicz.com/2010/05/clean-code-clean-logs-use-appropriate.html">previously</a>) seems irrelevant and smells like a <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">premature optimization</a>. Also, can you spot the duplication? There are very rare cases when having explicit condition is justified – when we can prove that constructing logging message is expensive. In other situations, just do your job of logging and let logging framework do its job (filtering).<br /><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://nurkiewicz.com/2010/05/clean-code-clean-logs-use-appropriate.html">Clean code, clean logs: use appropriate tools (1/10)</a></li><br /><li>Clean code, clean logs: logging levels are there for you (2/10)</li><br /><li><a href="http://nurkiewicz.com/2010/05/clean-code-clean-logs-do-you-know-what.html">Clean code, clean logs: do you know what you are logging?
