# Be My Guest

I'd love to have you as a guest in my podcast!
All you need is to know some technology or concept really well and be able to explain it in **under 4 minutes**.
At the moment each episode is downloaded more than 300 times.
You can either talk freely or answer e.g. the following questions:

* What is ...?
* Why/how ... is useful/important?
* Pros of ...
* Cons of ...

It's a monologue, so you can record it anywhere and at anytime you want.
Just let me know via Twitter DM ([@tnurkiewicz](https://twitter.com/tnurkiewicz)) or by [submitting a user voice](https://github.com/nurkiewicz/256/issues/new/choose) indicating you'd like to contribute.

## Requirements

* under 4 minutes
* not a product/sale pitch
* laptop's microphone is fine, as long as there's not [too much echo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgL51PXBd1A)

## In return

* I can place link to any materials (your blog/website/training) in the show-notes and episode's article
* I can replace podcast's cover image for this episode with your photo/logo
* Your name appears in the podcast title as a guest
